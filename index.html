    <h1>+5 Support</h1>
    <p>Thank you for your use and interest in Plus 5! Here you will find information on our data practices, find support for the app, and be able to provide feedback.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>+5 will collect data on app usage via Google Analytics. This data will only be used to help monitor total app usage (i.e., how many users we have, how many hours of usage, where users are located) in order to help us improve the app. For example,
        information on usage location can help us understand if more languages should be added in the future. Total number of sessions or hours of use can help us understand how many users of the app there are and whether support for the app needs to
        be increased (or if, unfortunately, users have stopped using the app). This sole purpose of collecting usage information is to help us improve user experience with the app.</p>

    <p>For more information on what information is collected, please refer to Google Firebase's documentation on <a href="https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039">Data Collection</a>.</p>

    <p> If you have any concerns or questions on hor we handle your data, please contact us directly via the links below. Thank you for your understanding!</p>
